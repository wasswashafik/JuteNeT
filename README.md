This code was used for called "Using-Machine-Learning-and-Image-Processing-for-Plant-Pest-and-Disease-Detection-and-Classification" 
currently under publication. The link will be provided after publication.

This is scratch coded script that can be used to extracting disease affected portions from images of Jute Plant Stems. 
Different image processing methods like Hue-based Segmentation, Morphological Analysis (i.e. erosion, dilation etc.), 
Blob Detection, Largest Connected Component, Color co-occurrence methodology, Texture Analysis etc. are implemented and applied. 
Extracted features are used for Jute pest disease identification using Multi-class SVM.

***************************************************************************************************************************************
It has two m.files that is to say (1) manin and (2) extraction. The main script entails all necessary codes needed to have this detection problem
solved and four extraction it has functions well commented and it can be understood simply. 

**************************************************************************************************************************************************
The image presented here, those numbers 1 through 5 indicate that the following;  [1] == Original image of diseased plant, [2] == After Pre-Preprocessing, 
[3] == Converted to HSV, [4] == Blob Detection and [5] == Segmented Images. Details about the images can be well exploied with in the upcoming paper soon.
